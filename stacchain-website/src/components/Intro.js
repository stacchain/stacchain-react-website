                Merkle trees are a fundamental component of blockchain
                technology, providing a way to efficiently verify data
                integrity. Each leaf node represents a block of data, and parent
                nodes are hashes of their respective child nodes. This structure
                allows for quick verification of any individual piece of data
                within the tree.
